As the quote that appears at the end of the essay:

"J'ai seulement fait ici un amas de fleurs étrangères, n'y ayant fourni du mien que le filet à les lier." ("I have gathered a posy of other men's flowers, and nothing but the thread that binds them is mine own.") — Montaigne, Essais, 1595

Readable for the thread the author weaves, but if one is looking to understand the paper deeply, I think, going down the hands-on route is the best way as the paper is about technique as much as theory.
